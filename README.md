Exploring Deep Learning for Chess Image Analysis

**2.EfficientNet**
Why: EfficientNet balances accuracy and computational efficiency by scaling depth, width, and resolution effectively. Chess piece classification may involve high-resolution images, and EfficientNet adapts well to such scenarios.
Strength: It offers high performance while being computationally lightweight, making it ideal for scalability.
Recommended Variant: Start with EfficientNetB0 for its simplicity, and move to B1 or B2 if better accuracy is needed.
**3. DenseNet**
Why: DenseNet connects each layer to every other layer, ensuring efficient feature reuse and gradient flow. This is helpful for small, structured datasets like chess pieces where details are paramount.
Strength: Dense connections help extract subtle variations in shapes and textures, which is ideal for differentiating between similar chess pieces like pawns and rooks.
Recommended Variant: DenseNet121 (lighter model with excellent feature extraction capabilities).
**4. InceptionV3 (Bonus Option)**
Why: InceptionV3 employs multiple filter sizes in a single convolution layer, which is excellent for capturing features at different scales. Chess piece images might have variations in size, orientation, and perspective, which this model handles well.
Strength: Robust against variability in image size and orientation.
